    <p>This tool determines the watershed, or upstream contributing area, for each point in your analysis layer. 
    </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you have point features representing  locations of waterborne contamination and you want to find the likely sources of the contamination. Since the source of the contamination must be somewhere within the watershed upstream of the point, you would use this tool to define the watersheds containing the sources of the contaminant.
    </p>
    <p>The location of your analysis points is important.  If they are not located precisely on a drainage line, the resulting watersheds may be very small and not useful for your analysis.  The   <b>Search distance to nearest drainage</b> can be used to adjust the location of your analysis points so they fall precisely on a drainage line in order to find the watershed that flows into the  point located on the drainage line.  The adjusted locations used to find the watersheds are written to the output layer&mdash;your input analysis points are not modified.
    </p>
    <p>The result is a group layer  containing  two layers:  the watersheds and the  adjusted points used to compute the watersheds.     
    </p>
    <p>The resulting watersheds  will have all of the attributes  of your input points  as well as these additional attributes:     
        <ul>
            <li> <i>PourPtID</i>&mdash;Contains the ID value from the input point
            </li>
            <li> <i>Area Square Kilometers</i>&mdash;Contains the area in square kilometers of the upstream watershed
            </li>
            <li> <i>Description</i> and <i>DataResolution</i>&mdash;Contains  information pertaining to the hydrologic data used to calculate the trace
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the features in the current map extent will be used to compute watersheds.  If unchecked, all features in the analysis layer  will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

            <p>If your analysis points are located away from a drainage line, the resulting watersheds are likely to be very small and not of much use  in determining the upstream source of contamination.  In most cases, you want your analysis point to snap to the nearest drainage line in order to find the watersheds that flows to a point located on the drainage line.  To find the closest drainage line, specify a search distance.  If you do not specify a search distance, the tool will compute and use a conservative search distance.  
            </p>
            <p>To use the exact location of your input point, specify a search distance of zero.  
            </p>
            <p>For analysis purposes, drainage lines have been precomputed by Esri using standard hydrologic models.  If there is no drainage line within the search distance, the location containing the highest flow accumulation within the search distance is used.
